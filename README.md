# Building-a-Virtual-Assistant-using-Python
Virtual assistants (VAs) help users or enterprises with a set of tasks previously only made possible by humans.  VAs use semantic and deep learning (such as deep neural networks [DNNs], natural language processing, prediction models, recommendations, and personalization) to assist people or automate tasks.
Vas listens to and observes behaviors, builds and maintains data models, and predicts and recommends actions. 
Vas can be deployed in several use cases, including virtual personal assistants, virtual customer assistants, and virtual employee assistants.
